/**
 * This document describes the interface of the Acrolinx Sidebar.
 *
 * Let's understand how the typical bootstrapping of an integration and the Acrolinx Sidebar works:
 *
 * 1) Load host editor of your integration
 * 2) Load your integration code
 * 3) Register your integration as acrolinxPlugin (var acrolinxPlugin = {...})
 *    @see AcrolinxPlugin interface for required methods
 * 4) Load sidebar and referenced libs code (usually sidebar.js, libs.js, sidebar.css)
 * 5) Once the sidebar has finished loading it will request the integration to initialize.
 *    acrolinxPlugin.requestInit() will be called.
 * 6) The acrolinxPlugin must call acrolinxSidebar.init(InitParameter).
 * 7) Once the init has finished, the plug-in will be notified: acrolinxPlugin.onInitFinished() is called.
 * 8) From time to time, the sidebar will call acrolinxPlugin.Configure() to push the latest configuration to the
 *    plug-in.
 * 9) If the user pushes the button "Check", acrolinxPlugin.requestGlobalCheck() is called.
 * 10) The acrolinxPlugin must call acrolinxSidebar.checkGlobal() to perform a check.
 *     @see acrolinxSidebar.checkGlobal()
 * 11) When the check finished, acrolinxPlugin.onCheckResult() is called and the sidebar displays cards for the issues.
 * 12) If the user clicks a card acrolinxPlugin.selectRanges() is called
 * 13) When the user selects a replacement acrolinxPlugin.replaceRanges() is called.
 * 14) ... @see method description on AcrolinxPlugin
 *
 * For a minimal integration (not feature complete) you must implement requestInit, requestGlobalCheck, configure,
 *   selectRanges, replaceRanges and download.

     * in the requested document. These indices reduce the search space later on, so that your search will be faster
     * and more precise. pro: fast, up to 100% precise - con: invasive, changes the source document
